## Installation
Because we need PostgreSQL database it should be installed at local machine drive and then loaded into npm node module packages. Installation process for postgresql we can find here [PostgreSQL Databse Installation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads). During the installation process default port should be `5432`. After database is installed localy npm pg packages should be loaded into node modules over cli terminal.

```bash
$ npm install pg
```
After packages are loaded database credentials should be populated into `.env` file like username, password, and database name. Check .env file for details. Also, there is a file `./db/schema.sql` and `./seeds/seeds.sql` that can be used to set database structure and to populate database with testing seeds, just uncoment it and run. Check file `schema.sql` and `seeds.sql`. It can be runned as follows:

```console
$ psql -U postgres 
Password for user postgres:
psql (16.2)
postgres=# \i ./db/schema.sql
DROP DATABASE
CREATE DATABASE
CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# \i ./seeds/seeds.sql
INSERT 0 3
INSERT 0 5
INSERT 0 8
INSERT 0 5
postgres=#
```
Otherwise you can run seeds over bash terminal as follows
```bash
$ nmm run seed
```
